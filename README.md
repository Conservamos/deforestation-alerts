# Conservamos Deforestation Alerts
We use the Global Forest Watch platform to send out deforestation alerts to private conservation initiatives in Peru. More background information can be found in this repository's Wiki.

# How to reuse the code
The code of this project consists of a script we have used to transform shape files and intersect them with alerts provided by GFW and to write alerts to a Google Sheet we use as our main working interface. We have tried to comment everything extensively so that you have an easier time running the system with your own data on your machine or on a server.
If there are things you don't understand, don't hesitate to create a Github issue or write us an [email](mailto:conservamospornaturaleza@gmail.com).

# Where to find the data
The data product we're using comes from the University of Maryland. They use Landsat images to detect deforestation. It is hosted on the Global Forest Watch platform through the [CartoDB SQL API](https://wri-01.cartodb.com/tables/per_umd_alerts/public/map).
You can head directly to [globalforestwatch.org](http://www.globalforestwatch.org/) to see the dataset visualized. Peruvian concession data is not proper open data yet. You can find shape files of [conservation and ecotourism concessions](https://github.com/Conservamos/deforestation-alerts/tree/master/shapes/con-eco) in this repository. We will try to keep them up to date.
If you are working in the conservation field or need data for your research, we can give you access to the final Google Sheet. Please send us an [email](mailto:conservamospornaturaleza@gmail.com) if your interested.

Thanks for your interest. Let's protect the rainforests together!
